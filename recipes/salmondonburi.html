    <h2>Ingredients</h2> <ul>
        <li>▢2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice (typically 1⅔ cups (250 g) per donburi serving)</li> 
        <li>▢5 oz sashimi-grade salmon</li> 
        <li>▢3 Tbsp ikura (salmon roe)</li> </ul>
        <h3>for the Toppings (optional) </h3>
        <ul> <li>▢2 shiso leaves (perilla/ooba)</li> <li>▢2 Tbsp shredded nori seaweed (kizami nori)</li></ul>
        <h3>for Serving</h3>
        <ul> <li>▢soy sauce</li> <li>▢wasabi</li> </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2> <ol>
        <li>Divide 2 servings cooked Japanese short-grain rice into individual (large) donburi bowls and let it cool slightly. You do not want the hot rice to cook the sashimi. </li>
        <li>Then, layer the slices of salmon on the rice like flower petals until you cover half of the rice. Place one shiso leaf in each bowl to cover the other half of the rice.</li>
        <li>Divide 3 Tbsp ikura (salmon roe) and add on top of each leaf. Garnish the bowls with 2 Tbsp shredded nori seaweed (kizami nori).</li>
        <li>Serve soy sauce in a small dish and put wasabi on the side. Mix the sauce and drizzle on top of the Salmon Sashimi Bowl to enjoy!</li>
